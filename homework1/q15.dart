/*15-What does it mean for Dart to be a statically-typed language, and how does it
impact the way variables are used?*/

/*Dart being a statically-typed language means that the type of a variable is known at compile time rather than at runtime. This impacts the way variables are used in several ways:
1. Type Safety: Since types are checked at compile time, it helps catch type-related errors early in the development process, reducing runtime errors.
2. Explicit Declarations: Developers can explicitly declare variable types, which can improve code readability and maintainability.
3. Performance: Statically-typed languages can optimize performance better than dynamically-typed languages because the compiler has more information about the types being used.
4. Tooling Support: Statically-typed languages often have better tooling support, such as code completion and refactoring tools, because the types are known ahead of time.
Overall, being statically-typed encourages developers to write more robust and reliable code by enforcing type constraints during the development process.*/
